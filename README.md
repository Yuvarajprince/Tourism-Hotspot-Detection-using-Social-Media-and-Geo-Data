## üåê Project Overview

The Tourism Hotspot Finder is an intelligent recommendation system that combines machine learning with interactive visualization to help travelers discover optimal destinations based on their preferences. The system was developed as part of our research into geospatial analysis and predictive modeling for tourism applications.

Key technical innovations:
- Hybrid recommendation system combining content-based and knowledge-based approaches
- Real-time accessibility analysis using geospatial features
- Ensemble learning techniques for improved prediction accuracy
